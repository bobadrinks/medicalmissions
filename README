!Description

This mobile game is built for Android devices, and has two simple game modes. When the app is launched, the player can tap through to the game selection screen, and then choose either Game Mode 1 or 2. An instructions page will then detail what the player should do to win (or not lose) the game. Each of the two game modes represents a different view on traditional medicine - colonial versus modern.

!Game Mode 1
The player taps on a block to change its direction. Two blocks move from opposite sides of the screen towards a border, and they move at different speeds. If either block touches the border, the game is lost.               * 

!Game Mode 2
The player moves the Sprite left or right by swiping left or right on the screen. The goal of this game mode is to catch falling objects. The Sprite automatically changes its movement direction if it runs into the side of the screen. The player wins after catching 20 objects.

Notice that in the first Mode, the player can only lose, and in the second, the player can only win. This is intentional.
